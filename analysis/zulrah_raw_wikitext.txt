'''Zulrah''' is a level 725 solo-only snake [[boss]]. Before the player can fight Zulrah, players must have completed [[Regicide]] to the point of reaching [[Port Tyras]], as well as having spoken with [[High Priestess Zul-Harcinqa]] to offer themselves as the sacrifice in place of the [[sacrifice|gnome child]], as [[Priestess Zul-Gwenwynig|Zul-Gwenwynig]] will prevent the player from boarding the boat until Zul-Harcinqa allows them to be the sacrifice.

Killing Zulrah is a required task for the hard [[Western Provinces Diary#Hard|Western Provinces Achievement Diary]], which in turn is a requirement for upgrading to the [[Elite Void Knight equipment|Elite Void]] set.

==History==
As described in the [[stained journal]], Zulrah was created during the [[Dragonkin Conflicts]] as an experiment by an unnamed [[dragonkin]] living in the [[Poison Waste]]. Originally seen as one of many failures, Zulrah was discarded into the swamp, where it grew into an unexpectedly powerful and intelligent serpent. It was found once again by its dragonkin creator, who named it "Zulrah" before eventually being eaten by their own creation.

===Drops===
''In addition to the 100% drops, the player will also have two rolls on Zulrah's drop table, excluding tertiary items, which have only one roll. The displayed drop chances represent a single roll.''

Below lists the approximate drop rates '''per roll''' of any '''specific''' item, which takes into account the fact that there are 4 different items in this drop table. Although uncut onyx appears on the unique drop table and in the collection log, it is not exclusive to Zulrah.''
